## Face Detection using OpenCV and Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV.  It's a core component of my image recognition project for the CodeClause internship program.

## Project Overview

This script utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier from OpenCV to detect faces in live video captured from a webcam. It highlights detected faces by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Run

1. **Save the code:** Copy the code provided in `face_detection.py` (or whatever you named your file) and save it as a Python file.
2. **Execute the script:**  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run:

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

3. **View the results:** A window titled "Face Detection" will appear, displaying the live feed from your webcam with detected faces highlighted by bounding boxes. 

4. **Exit the program:** Press the 'q' key on your keyboard to stop the script and close the window.

## Future Enhancements

* **Object Detection:** Expand the project to detect other objects beyond faces.
* **Image Classification:**  Integrate image classification to identify the type of object detected.
* **Real-world Applications:** Explore applications like security systems, facial recognition, or image tagging.
